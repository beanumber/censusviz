Description: The censusviz package facilitate the process of analyzing and visualizing historical census data through 
    3 primary features: (1) converting historical demographic data from IPUMS into an accessible format for analysis 
    and joining it with geospatial census tract data so that it is easy to visualize on a map, (2) visualize the distribution 
    of demographic data by census tract for a specified region and year on a leaflet map, and (3) create a simple shiny app that 
    allows users to interactively explore changes over time in demographics through leaflet maps and data tables. These three 
    elements will build off of each other such that the user can either simply access the data that they want and perform their own 
    analysis, or they can use the functionality of the package to visualize it spatially using individual maps or a shiny app.
